/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 * 
 * GRADING
 * 
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Upload this file to D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // to take a list of strings "xs" and concatenate all strings using a string "term"
  // as a terminator (not delimiter) between strings.  You MUST use your foldLeft defined above.

  // If the list is empty or there is no number greater than or equal to "a", throw a RuntimeException (with no argument).
